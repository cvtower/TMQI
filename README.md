This is a Python2/3 reimplementation of the Tone Mapped Image Quality Index.

This implementation and the Matlab original has significant differences
and yield different results!

The original article can be found here: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6319406/

The reference implementation in Matlab: https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~z70wang/research/tmqi/

The original source code does not specify license, except that it should be referenced
and the original paper should be cited. 
I put this re-implementation under AGPLv3 license, hopefully this is compatible
with the original intention. The test photos are taken by me, and I donate them to public domain.
